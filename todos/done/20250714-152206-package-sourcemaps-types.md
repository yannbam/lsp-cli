# Package and Export Sourcemaps and Types
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 17496

## Original Todo
also package and export the sourcemaps and types so other apps can reuse them

## Description
We need to enhance the lsp-cli build process to generate and export TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) and sourcemaps (.js.map) so that other applications can use lsp-cli as a library with full type support and debugging capabilities. This involves modifying the build configuration to generate these artifacts and updating package.json to properly expose them. Additionally, we'll create a library entry point separate from the CLI to expose the core functionality programmatically.

## Implementation Plan
To package and export sourcemaps and types for lsp-cli:

- [x] Create library entry point src/lib.ts that exports core classes and types (LanguageClient, ServerManager, Logger, all types from types.ts)
- [x] Update tsconfig.json to enable declaration file generation with `"declaration": true` and `"declarationMap": true`
- [x] Modify build script to use TypeScript compiler (tsc) for generating declaration files alongside esbuild
- [x] Update esbuild command to generate sourcemaps with `--sourcemap` flag
- [x] Create separate build outputs: dist/cli.js for CLI and dist/lib.js for library usage
- [x] Update package.json with proper exports field for dual CLI/library usage and types field pointing to dist/lib.d.ts
- [x] Add dist/**/*.d.ts and dist/**/*.js.map to files array in package.json to include in published package
- [x] Test that types and sourcemaps work correctly when importing the package

## Notes
- Decided to use TypeScript compiler output directly for library files instead of bundling with esbuild
  - This provides better tree-shaking for consumers
  - Allows importing individual modules
  - More idiomatic for library distribution
- CLI is still bundled for single-file executable distribution
