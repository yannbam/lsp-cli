## üìù Notes

### Why No PR #1 (Foundation)?
All PR branches were created directly from upstream/main v0.1.3, so they already incorporate the new type system (Supertype structure). A separate foundation/compatibility PR was not needed.

### Why PR #3 is Missing?
PR #3 on upstream is a Go language support PR from another contributor (momiom). Our numbering is independent.

### Fork PRs (yannbam/lsp-cli)
The following PRs exist on the fork but can be closed since we've submitted to upstream:
- Fork PR #5: CLI Wrappers ‚Üí Superseded by upstream PR #6
- Fork PR #6: Python ‚Üí Superseded by upstream PR #4
- Fork PR #7: Rust ‚Üí Superseded by upstream PR #5
