## üìã Remaining PRs - Implementation Strategy

### PR #1: üîß Foundation (Type System Compatibility)

**Priority:** CRITICAL - All other PRs depend on this
**Complexity:** HIGH - Requires merge conflict resolution
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Goal:** Make our codebase compatible with upstream v0.1.3 type system changes

**Key Conflicts:**
1. **src/types.ts** - `supertypes` changed from `string[]` to `Supertype[]`
2. **src/language-client.ts** - Major refactoring of preview extraction
3. **package.json** - Version, entry points, build system
4. **llms.md** - Documentation merge

**Approach:**
```bash
# Start from main branch (has all our features)
git checkout -b pr1-foundation main

# Merge upstream/main
git merge upstream/main

# Resolve conflicts:
# 1. Accept upstream's Supertype interface structure
# 2. Keep our additional fields (comments, Python/Rust support)
# 3. Update all code to use Supertype[] instead of string[]
# 4. Merge build scripts (theirs + our wrapper copying)
# 5. Merge documentation

# Test thoroughly
npm run build
npm test

# Commit and push
git push -u origin pr1-foundation
```

**Critical Changes Needed:**
- Update any code that accesses `supertypes` to use `.name` property
- Ensure test fixtures expect `Supertype[]` format
- Update jq query examples in documentation

### PR #2: üêç Python Support

**Priority:** HIGH
**Complexity:** MODERATE
**Dependencies:** PR #1 (must be based on pr1-foundation)
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Goal:** Add Python language support with pyright LSP server

**Approach:**
```bash
# Branch from pr1-foundation (has compatible type system)
git checkout -b pr2-python pr1-foundation

# Python support is already in this branch from main
# Just need to clean up commits and ensure compatibility

# Squash/clean commits into logical structure:
git rebase -i upstream/main

# Keep these commits:
# - Add Python to supported languages
# - Add pyright LSP server config
# - Add Python # comment handling
# - Add Python test fixtures
# - Update README with Python docs

# Test Python support
npm run build
# Test with Python fixtures

git push -u origin pr2-python
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/server-manager.ts` - Python server config
- `src/language-client.ts` - Python # comment handling
- `src/index.ts` - Add 'python' to supported languages
- `src/types.ts` - Add 'python' to SupportedLanguage type
- `test/fixtures/python/*` - Comprehensive test suite
- `README.md` - Python documentation

---

### PR #3: ü¶Ä Rust Support

**Priority:** HIGH
**Complexity:** MODERATE
**Dependencies:** PR #1 (must be based on pr1-foundation)
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Goal:** Add Rust language support with rust-analyzer

**Approach:** Same as PR #2, but for Rust-specific changes

```bash
git checkout -b pr3-rust pr1-foundation
git rebase -i upstream/main  # Clean up commits
# Test Rust support
git push -u origin pr3-rust
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/server-manager.ts` - Rust server config
- `src/index.ts` - Add 'rust' to supported languages
- `src/types.ts` - Add 'rust' to SupportedLanguage type
- `test/fixtures/rust/*` - Comprehensive Cargo project
- `README.md` - Rust documentation

---

### PR #4: üí¨ Comment Extraction

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Complexity:** LOW-MODERATE
**Dependencies:** PR #1 (must be based on pr1-foundation)
**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour

**Goal:** Add inline comment extraction for e/code transparency

**Approach:** Same pattern as Python/Rust PRs

```bash
git checkout -b pr4-comments pr1-foundation
# Comment extraction code already in branch
# Clean up commits, test, push
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/language-client.ts` - extractInlineComments() methods
- `src/types.ts` - Add `comments?: string[]` field
- `test/comment-extraction.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests
- Test fixtures for all languages
- `README.md` - Comment field documentation

---

## üéØ Recommended Order

1. **PR #1 (Foundation)** - Do this first, test thoroughly
2. **PR #2 (Python)** OR **PR #3 (Rust)** - Either order works
3. **PR #3 (Rust)** OR **PR #2 (Python)** - Other one
4. **PR #4 (Comments)** - Simplest, can be last

## üìä Current Repository State

**Main Branch:**
- Based on old upstream (pre-v0.1.3)
- Has all our features (Python, Rust, comments, wrappers)
- Uses old `supertypes: string[]` format
- Commit count: 55 commits ahead of upstream

**Upstream/Main:**
- Version 0.1.3
- New `Supertype` interface with `typeArguments`
- New build system (dist/cli.js)
- Enhanced preview extraction
- 17 commits we don't have

---

## üö® Critical Notes

1. **Type System Breaking Change:**
   - Upstream changed `supertypes` from `string[]` to `Supertype[]`
   - This affects ALL code that reads/writes supertypes
   - ALL test assertions need updating
   - JQ query examples in docs need updating

2. **Build System Changes:**
   - Upstream: `dist/cli.js` (not `dist/index.js`)
   - Our wrappers: Need to be added to their build
   - Files array: Must include wrapper scripts

3. **Constructor Signature:**
   - Upstream LanguageClient constructor still has `serverPath` parameter
   - Our branch might have removed it
   - Check and reconcile

4. **Test Compatibility:**
   - Ensure test fixtures work with new type system
   - Python/Rust tests must pass
   - Comment extraction tests must pass

## üí° Tips for Next Session

1. **Start Fresh:** PR #1 (Foundation) deserves full attention
2. **Test Incrementally:** Build and test after each conflict resolution
3. **Use Git Wisely:** Commit checkpoints during conflict resolution
4. **Refer to Analysis:** UPSTREAM_PR_ANALYSIS.md has detailed conflict strategies
5. **Stay Organized:** One PR at a time, test thoroughly
6. **Document Changes:** Keep track of what changed during merge resolution
