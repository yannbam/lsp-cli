### FORMER CRITICAL TASKS (Now Complete)

#### **Create Python Test Fixtures**
- [ ] **Comprehensive Python test fixtures** following the Rust pattern (7+ files, diverse constructs)
  - [ ] Basic Python constructs (classes, functions, variables)
  - [ ] Advanced Python features (decorators, context managers, async/await)
  - [ ] Type hints and generics (`List[T]`, `Dict[K, V]`, `Optional`, `Union`)
  - [ ] Magic methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__call__`, etc.)
  - [ ] Property decorators (`@property`, `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`)
  - [ ] Inheritance and multiple inheritance
  - [ ] Import patterns and module structure
  - [ ] Exception classes and error handling constructs
  - [ ] Docstring variations (Google, NumPy, Sphinx styles)
- [ ] **Test project structure** with proper Python project files
  - [ ] `requirements.txt` with real dependencies
  - [ ] `pyproject.toml` with build configuration  
  - [ ] `setup.py`, `setup.cfg` combinations
  - [ ] `.gitignore` for Python artifacts (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, etc.)
- [ ] **Verify symbol extraction accuracy** across all test cases
- [ ] **Document test results** and any limitations discovered

#### **Essential Validation (Linux-focused)**
- [ ] **Test with common Python versions** (3.8, 3.10, 3.12 - what's available on this system)
- [ ] **Test basic virtual environment scenarios** (standard venv, common setups)
- [ ] **Error handling validation** (malformed Python files, syntax errors, missing pylsp)
- [ ] **Performance validation** with medium-sized codebases (not massive, just realistic)

### ‚ö° IMPORTANT (Should have for good user experience)

#### **Core Reliability**
- [ ] **Test different pylsp configurations** (default vs common plugin combinations)
- [ ] **Project file detection validation** (ensure all Python project types are recognized)
- [ ] **Documentation extraction reliability** (ensure docstrings work consistently)

#### **User Experience**
- [ ] **Better error messages** for common Python setup issues
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** for Python-specific problems
- [ ] **Usage examples** for Python projects in documentation

### üí° OPTIONAL (Nice to have, but not essential)

#### **Advanced Features** 
- [ ] **Hierarchical symbol support investigation** (research DocumentSymbol format possibility)
- [ ] **Python-specific symbol improvements** (property detection, async identification)
- [ ] **Virtual environment auto-detection** (conda, pipenv, poetry)
- [ ] **Cross-platform testing** (Windows, macOS - we can't test this anyway)

#### **Integration Enhancements**
- [ ] **Python project type detection** (Django, Flask recognition)
- [ ] **Dependency analysis integration** (parse requirements for context)
- [ ] **Large codebase testing** (performance with very large projects)

### üöÄ FUTURE (Can be done much later)

#### **Advanced Features**
- [ ] **Jupyter Notebook support** (`.ipynb` files)
- [ ] **Python stub file analysis** (`.pyi` files in depth)
- [ ] **Cython support** (`.pyx` files)
- [ ] **Python 2 compatibility** (if needed for legacy codebases)

## Rust Support Tasks

### üî• CRITICAL (Must validate before considering Rust complete)

#### **Rust Status Verification** 
- [ ] **Audit current Rust implementation**
  - [ ] Verify end-to-end functionality with existing test fixtures
  - [ ] Test rust-analyzer integration and symbol extraction  
  - [ ] Validate toolchain detection (rustc + cargo)
  - [ ] Check project file detection (Cargo.toml)
  - [ ] Test with basic Rust project types (binary, library)
- [ ] **Identify any gaps or issues** in current implementation
- [ ] **Document Rust implementation status** and any needed fixes

### ‚ö° IMPORTANT (Should validate for reliability)

#### **Rust Reliability Testing**
- [ ] **Test fixture validation**
  - Verify the 7-file, 99-symbol test fixture actually works correctly
  - Ensure all major Rust constructs are properly extracted
- [ ] **Error handling** (missing rust-analyzer, malformed Cargo.toml, compilation errors)
- [ ] **Performance validation** with medium-sized Rust codebases

### üí° OPTIONAL (Enhancement, not essential)
- [ ] **Rust workspace support** (multi-crate projects)
- [ ] **rust-analyzer configuration optimization**
- [ ] **Advanced Rust features** (macros, proc-macros, complex generics)

---

## Cross-Language Tasks

### üî• CRITICAL (Code quality issues affecting functionality)
- [ ] **Clean up TypeScript warnings** that could indicate real bugs
  - Remove unused private class members flagged by linter
  - Address any diagnostic issues that might affect runtime

### ‚ö° IMPORTANT (Improve user experience)

#### **Documentation & Examples**
- [ ] **Create usage examples** for each supported language
  - Basic command examples for Python and Rust
  - Common project structure examples
- [ ] **Error troubleshooting guide** for setup issues
- [ ] **LLM consumption documentation** (`--llm` flag usage and integration)

#### **Architecture Improvements**
- [ ] **Symbol extraction architecture review**
  - Document the SymbolInformation vs DocumentSymbol handling pattern
  - Consider if other LSP servers might have similar format variations
  - Create reusable patterns for future language additions

### üí° OPTIONAL (Future improvements)
- [ ] **Performance benchmarking** across all supported languages
- [ ] **Integration examples** with other development tools
- [ ] **Advanced configuration** options for power users

### üöÄ FUTURE (Infrastructure, not immediate priority)
- [ ] **Automated testing setup** for language integrations
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** (when we have access to multiple platforms)

## Implementation Priority Summary

### **Next Session Should Focus On:**
1. üî• **Python test fixtures** - Critical for validating the implementation works correctly
2. üî• **Rust status verification** - Make sure the recent Rust implementation actually works
3. ‚ö° **Basic error handling** - Ensure both languages fail gracefully with clear messages

### **Success Criteria for "Production Ready":**
- ‚úÖ **Python**: Comprehensive test fixtures validate all major constructs work correctly
- ‚úÖ **Rust**: Existing implementation verified to work with real Rust projects  
- ‚úÖ **Both**: Clean error messages when toolchain/LSP server is missing or misconfigured
- ‚úÖ **Both**: Reasonable performance on typical development projects (not massive codebases)

### **Development Philosophy:**
- **Focus on this machine first** - Linux compatibility is what matters most
- **Real-world usage patterns** over theoretical edge cases
- **Reliable core functionality** over advanced features
- **Clear error messages** over perfect feature coverage
